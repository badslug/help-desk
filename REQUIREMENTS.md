# Objective

Create a customer support application that serves two types of users: the end user and the support tech.

- **End User:** Interacts with an AI-guided assistant through a chat interface to create support tickets. The assistant should guide users through a series of questions to gather information needed for a support ticket, including a category for the issue.
- **Support Tech:** Manages and views the support tickets created by end users. This includes accessing ticket details such as user name, issue description, and category.

# Required Features

1. **User Interface:** Develop a chat interface for end users to interact with the AI assistant. Provide a simple interface for support techs to view and manage tickets.
2. **AI Assistant:** Implement basic AI functionality to create a guided conversation with end users. The assistant should be able to ask relevant questions and gather necessary details for the support ticket, including creating de-duplicated categories.
3. **Ticket Management:** Store tickets with details such as user name, issue description, and category. Allow support techs to access and manage these tickets.

# Additional Guidelines

- Aim to minimize boilerplate code. For example, you do not need to implement authentication.
- Focus on creating a polished and intuitive user interface. The user experience is a key part of the evaluation.

# Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** The application should meet all the specified requirements and function correctly.
- **Code Quality:** Your code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to understand.
- **User Experience:** A polished and intuitive user interface will enhance your score. Consider the overall user journey and how the interface facilitates interaction with the assistant.
- **Innovation:** Creative approaches to solving the problem or enhancing the user experience are encouraged.
